Tool for managing a large collection of repositories in git. If you have 100 git-versioned projects,
keeping tabs on everything can be quite troublesome.

That's where *ingit* comes in. It mimics selected git commands, however you can perform the same
action on a group of repositories instead of just one.

Additionally, it has an interactive mode in which you can go over your repositories and quickly
perform typical suggested actions in each individual repository based on its current status.
